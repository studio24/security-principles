# Governance framework

Simon Jones, MD, is responsible for security at Studio 24. This is managed on a day-to-day basis by Alan Isaacson, Support Developer. Studio 24 is [Cyber Essentials](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cyberessentials/overview) accredited.
 
We have policies in place that cover:

* The testing/updating and deployment of the website codebase.
* The testing/updating of the server OS (operating system) and software packages.
* The testing/updating and deployment of the CMS (Content Management System) and the relevant plugins used.
  
The hosting infrastructure is monitored with automated alerts/alarms as required. 

On a project basis, we identify security and data privacy risks and document these in a risk register. Mitigations are put in place and monitored by the Project Manager to ensure we are addressing these.

We have a set of [secure development principles](secure-development.md) we follow to help ensure good security. Security issues that affect projects is peer reviewed by Simon Jones.

Where required, we organise an independent third-party agency to conduct a security penetration test (pen test) on the website before launch. This can be repeated on an annual basis or when significant new functionality is introduced.
