# Supply chain security

Our policy is to only use software that is currently supported. Our normal process is to update software as part of technical support. Where a major upgrade is required (e.g. upgrading between major versions) that requires two hours or more of work then we will schedule this in as maintenance work.

Studio 24 is [Cyber Essentials](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cyberessentials/overview) accredited so has an obligation for running supported and up-to-date software.
   
We have a range of tools that monitor and report on software versions and system updates, which are automated wherever possible (e.g. GitHub Dependabot).
