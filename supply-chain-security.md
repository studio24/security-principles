# Supply chain security

Our policy is to only use software that is currently supported. We only install 3rd party software from official sources and package libraries [Packagist](https://packagist.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). We have a range of tools that monitor and report on software versions and system updates, which are automated wherever possible (e.g. GitHub Dependabot).

Our normal process is to update software as part of technical support. Where a major upgrade is required (e.g. upgrading between major versions) that requires two hours or more of work then we will schedule this in as maintenance work.

Studio 24 is [Cyber Essentials](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cyberessentials/overview) accredited so has an obligation for running supported and up-to-date software.
   
It is our policy to use currently supported software for any 3rd party software we rely on for your project. If you have a current technical support contract with us we will perform updates as part of our support service. Where major upgrades are required which require additional work we'll highlight this and discuss a suitable plan.
