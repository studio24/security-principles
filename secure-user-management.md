# Secure user management

As per the [guidance documentation](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cloud/the-cloud-security-principles/principle-9-secure-user-management) we ensure there is a single, well-defined user account model.

* Studio 24 uses granular access control, according to the ‘principle of least privilege’, enabling both ‘standard’ and ‘administrative’ user accounts as required. By default, we setup CMS admin users with only the permissions they require to manage content.
* Only named client contacts can approve access to management systems, such as CMSs.
* Support is available via telephone, web and email. 
* Other customers cannot access, modify or otherwise affect your service configuration.
