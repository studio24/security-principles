# Secure user management

As per the [guidance documentation](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cloud/the-cloud-security-principles/principle-9-secure-user-management) we ensure there is a single, well-defined user account model

* Access to your data and services, including accesses to management interfaces is via named client approval only.
* Support is available via telephone, web and email. 
* Studio 24 uses granular access control, according to the ‘principle of least privilege’, enabling both ‘standard’ and ‘administrative’ user accounts as required. 
* Other customers cannot access, modify or otherwise affect your service configuration
