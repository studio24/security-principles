# Secure use of service 

We follow the principle of ensuring web applications and cloud service environments are secure by design.

During a project we will review security configuration and risks and document these, discussing them with the client. Where training is required, for example how to use the CMS and setup two-factor authentication, we provide this as part of the project.
