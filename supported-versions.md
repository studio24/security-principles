# Supported versions

Our policy is to only use supported and up-to-date software.

We aim to update this page on a semi-regular basis.

[^1]: Officially, WordPress only maintains the current major version. Previous major releases before this may or may not get security updates as serious exploits are discovered.
[^2]: We only use long-term support (LTS) releases of NodeJs, which typically guarantees that critical bugs will be fixed for a total of 30 months.
