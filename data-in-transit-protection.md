# Data in transit protection

We implement as many of the suggested best practice methods as possible to ensure data security.
## Encryption
We use HTTP to secure network traffic for websites and web applications using TLS version 1.2 and/or TLS 1.3.
## Network protection
Network and system access is via a secure VPN and authorised SSH key only.
## Authentication
Any endpoints such as a database or API are accessible via a secure key or password only. These may also have the additional network/IP restrictions placed upon them.
