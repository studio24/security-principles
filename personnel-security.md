# Personnel security

We follow the principle of least privilege, where a user only has access to what they need in order to perform their responsibilities.

We limit access to the AWS cloud hosting service to the Support Team. Developers may have access to data for development purposes, which is accessed via the Support Team.

When we hire new staff we undertake security screening that follows the Baseline Personnel Security Standard (BPSS). The three checks are: 

* Identify, this is when we confirm the name and current address along with a visual comparison from supporting documentation, at this point we will also get the potential employee to supply their National Insurance Number. 
* Nationality and Immigration status (including an entitlement to undertake the work in question), we carry out Right to Work Checks by requesting documentation as required by the UK Government. 
* Employment and educational history for the previous 3 years in writing. All of these checks are completed before a formal job offer is made and our HR records (including the above checks) are kept for 6 years after an employee has left the company.
