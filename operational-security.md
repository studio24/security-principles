# Operational security

## Configuration and change management
* The hosting environment and updates are tested within a sandbox environment prior and peer reviewed prior going live. 
* Studio 24 uses software autonomy to manage the hosting environment and all changes can be audited.

## Vulnerability management

* Any known vulnerabilities that are being exploited in the wild are addressed as a matter of urgency, via whatever the recommended solution is (eg: installing a patch or removing a package).

* Patching and updating of the operating system and the CMS are part of our support package.

## Protective Monitoring
* We have performance alerts in place that notify us when system resources are escalated to an extreme level,
* We use monitoring and alerting packages that check the availability and response of 5 minute intervals.

## Incident management
After being alerted/notified of an incident the process will vary based upon the incident.  

In the first instance, it will be an investigation by the Hosting team to check logs files or running processes within the environment.  

Studio 24 produces an incident report for events such as site outages to notify the client of key information including but not limited to:
* Summary information 
* Incident duration 
* Cause of incident 
* How the incident was resolved 
* Steps taken to mitigate a repetition of the incident 
* Suggested/further actions (as required) to mitigate a repetition of the incident
